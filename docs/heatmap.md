# How to calculate risk

The **risk heat map** visualizes likelihood vs. impact.

- **Likelihood**: the probability of an event occurring.
- **Impact**: the magnitude of the consequence.

Multiply *likelihood Ã— impact* to determine the **risk score**.  
Use the color grid on the right to interpret the results.

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Low         | Low     | Minimal     |
| High        | High    | Critical    |

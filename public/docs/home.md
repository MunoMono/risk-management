# Risk management app  

The **Risk management app** is a tool designed to help PhD researchers systematically identify, track, and manage risks that may impact their research journey.  

By organizing risks into categories such as **Academic**, **Practice**, **Ethics**, and **Well-being**, the app provides a structured way to assess likelihood, impact, and response strategies.  

This tool supports:  

- **Clarity**: Risks are captured in a transparent, structured register.  
- **Monitoring**: Early warning triggers ensure issues are spotted before they escalate.  
- **Decision-making**: Response strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept) guide practical next steps.  
- **Accountability**: Each risk has a clear owner and stakeholder group.  

### Key benefits

- Track **academic risks** such as delays, lack of novelty, or missed KPIs.  
- Manage **practice-related risks** involving technical systems, dependencies, and sustainability.  
- Address **ethical challenges**, including inclusivity, consent, and sensitive data.  
- Support **well-being** by monitoring workload, stress, and support systems.  

The ultimate goal is to give researchers, supervisors, and institutions a **comprehensive, proactive approach** to ensure PhD projects succeed without being derailed by unmanaged risks.
